# Scheveningen

A simple starter for creating a project using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). The project also configured [ESLint](eslint.org) with recommendations from [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), precommit hooks by [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [control commit messages](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint). You can disable any of these parts as you wish, or add something of your own
